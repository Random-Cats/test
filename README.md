# Devlog

- added a lot of imgs hehe
- it does lag a bit when clicking fast because it finds loads a new img every time. I want to preload like 3-4 images to prevent the laggy feeling.
- I'm slowly learning how to do Full Stack stuff again
- this is gonna be so fun once it gets going
##### TODO
- add a default img before the clicking starts
- eventually add all the imgs I have and rename them all to be shorter
- run the code.sh on my NAS to update the paths.txt file every so often
- decide how often to build and deploy the site as there is a limit to the Action time [@here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/administering-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration)
- rearrange buttons and containers to maximize cat img size
- add a small pop-up to explain how things work
- decide on theme to be more charming

- I want to add a light/dark mode toggle switch that has a cat in it depending on which mode. An orange cat when it's light mode, a black/gray cat when it's dark mode. idk how to do that but I'll find out.
